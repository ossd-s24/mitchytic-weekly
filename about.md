The main tenet of my life is figuring out how to make it a fulfilling one, and self improvement has been the most efficient way to do this from what I've found. I enjoy going to the gym, playing League of Legends, reading books, and coding random things whenever I feel like it. If I can get better at something, I'm probably going to enjoy doing it.

My favorite food is Mei Cai Kou Rou, but I'd probably die before the age of 40 if I ate it every day.
