## FreeCodeCamp Evaluation

I think FreeCodeCamp has done an amazing job with preparing people who want to get into open source work for what they need to do if they want to contribute. They have extremely in depth guides and documentation on how to do everything, and I felt supported going through all of the points they had written down. I also am a big fan of the community they have going on as it is very big, very active, and open to newcomers. I am likely to absorb a lot of good practices from working with the codebase and absorbing the styles of the people who are maintaining the project.

## Working on the project

I am excited about joining the community for the project because they seem very well put together and I feel like I can find mentorship from trying to get some commits in. I am a bit scared about getting the project working on my local system since I need to make a virtual linux emulator if 10 hours a week on their hosted service isn't enough. Getting WSL working shouldn't be too bad since I've done it before for other things that needed a linux environment, but I'm always scared that I am going to mess things up when I have to interact with remote repositories with a command line, and this time there's two layers of remoteness since I have to interact with a virtual linux environment that interacts with a remote branch on github.
