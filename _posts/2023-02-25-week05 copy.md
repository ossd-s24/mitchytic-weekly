title: Week 5 - Open Source In the World
---

## Videos

I was pleasantly surprised by how much impact open source software and hardware had in the world. Because of how easy it is to adopt open source stuff for projects in hardware and software, people have free reign to make extremely in depth and widespread projects with big influence since the overhead for getting started is so low. It was cool to see how researchers got their communities with people of all backgrounds who weren't necessarily inclined towards science to start with involved in their projects.

As a computer scientist, I can strive to create open source code for people so that they can easily and cheaply do a task that would otherwise cost a good amount of money to buy as a service from a corporation.

## Open source contributions

I haven't made any contributions because I am currently trying to figure out how to make a meaningful contribution towards Calibre and it is a bit intimidating. They appear to be open to contributions, but I have no idea how their app works or how I can help out with stuff because I can't find any guides or channels for helping new contributors get in. I picked Calibre to work on because I use it every day to read my books on my computer, and I feel like I will have more motivation to get my contributions in since I like the app a lot and use it regularly in my life as opposed to picking a random project that isn't related to me.
