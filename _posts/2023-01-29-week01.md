## Open Source

When I hear the term open source, I think of a community of people who work together to make good software that aims to help humanity advance forward due to a sense of duty to the species. Open source has advantages over closed source programs in that it fosters collaboration, there is flexibility since there are no big-wig shareholders or venture capitalists to answer to, it is cost effective, there is a high degree of transparency and trust between users and creators, and there are active communities that actively maintain the product to allow for great longevity. There are issues though; maintenance and creation of open source software requires motivation in the absence of large monetary compensation, closed source software has more consistent standards for quality control, there is commercial support and training in companies that maintain their own software, and closed source software allows for controlled distribution that lets parties maintain a competitive advantage in their fields.

## Projects

I used audacity for recording and audio editing, I use VLC for watching videos as it works well with pretty much any esoteric file type I get when I download from online, I use calibre for reading epub books that are acquired online through legitimate sources as well as cracking books on my amazon kindle account so I can read them on my phone's ereader, and I use youtube-dl to download youtube videos.
